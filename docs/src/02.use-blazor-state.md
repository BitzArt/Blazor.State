## Use Blazor.State
In this documentation we will review the general installation, configuration and usage.

### Installation

Install [package](https://github.com/BitzArt/Blazor.State) to your project. <!--TODO: Link to Nuget package after publishing-->

### Configure Blazor.State

To configure Blazor.State, you need to add it to your DI container. You can do this by calling the AddBlazorState extension method on your IServiceCollection instance. For that feature you need to add it both to your Client project and to you Server project as well.
```cs
services.AddBlazorState(builder =>
    {
        // Configure Blazor.State here
    });
```
When configuring Blazor.State, first you need to add assemblies that contain your persistent components. You can add them by calling AddAssembly~ extension methods that suits you better:
```cs
services.AddBlazorState(builder =>
    {
        // Add assemblies here using various extensions methods
        builder.AddAssemblyContaining<_Imports>();
        
        builder.AddAssemblyContaining(typeof(_Imports));
    });
```

### Use Blazor.State

For making it work, you just need to do 3 simple steps:

1. Inherit your code-behind components from a class **PersistentComponentBase**
```cs
public partial class YourComponent: PersistentComponentBase
{
    // Field, properties, constructors and methods here
}
```

2. Add inheritance from **PersistentComponentBase** in your .razor components by using directive **@inherits**
```cs
@page "/route"
@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly
@inherits PersistentComponentBase
```

3. Use **ComponentStateAttribute** to mark properties that needs to be stored across full render process
```cs
public partial class YourComponent: PersistentComponentBase
{
    [ComponentState]
    public int YourProperty { get; private set; } = 0;
}
```
