## Persistent Component Lifecycle

**Blazor.State** adds several new lifecycle methods to your persistent components, aside from the normal **Blazor** lifecycle methods, and also slightly modifies the existing ones.

Normally, the component's lifecycle on each of the rendering environments will look something like the following:

1. [RenderTreeBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.rendering.rendertreebuilder) creates a component frame while building a render tree, which implies the component's constructor being called. 

2. The component receives it's initial [parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/#component-parameters). 
 
3. Before proceeding, the component first ensures it's initial prerequisites are met. A prerequisite is considered initial if it's `AllowComponentInitialization` property is `false`. These are the prerequisites that need to be met before the component's initialization can begin.

4. After the component ensures it's initial prerequisites are met, the component's `Initialize` and `InitializeAsync` methods are invoked. This is where you can perform any initialization logic that does not have any dependencies on the component's internal render tree. These methods are awaited, allowing the component to prepare it's initial necessary state before the component is first rendered. At this point, the component has not yet started rendering.

5. The component begins rendering.

6. While the component's rendering has already been triggered, this component's own lifecycle continues further. All of the following steps can have dependencies on the component's internal render tree. Since the component's internal render tree has already started rendering, this component's descendants in the render tree are also getting started with their own lifecycles from here on.

7. If this component is being initialized for the second time (while rendering interactively after a prior prerender), the component's state is restored. 

8. The component ensures it's secondary prerequisites are met. A prerequisite is considered secondary if it's `AllowComponentInitialization` property is `true`. These prerequisites may depend on the component's internal render tree. Since the component's internal render tree has already started rendering, this step can allow the component to wait for some actions to be performed by it's descendants in the render tree, before this component can proceed with it's own logic.

9.  The component's `OnInitialized` and `OnInitializedAsync` methods are invoked and awaited.

10. If this is the component's first initialization across the rendering environments, `InitializeState` and `InitializeStateAsync` methods are invoked and awaited. This is the perfect place to initialize your component's state, as these methods will only be called once during the component's entire lifecycle between the rendering environments.
