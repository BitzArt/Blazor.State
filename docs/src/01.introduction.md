## Introduction
Welcome to Blazor.State - a nuget package that saves component state between render modes in Blazor.

### What is Blazor.State?
Blazor.State is a Nuget package that provides saving and transferring data between render phases.

#### Usage sample
During Initializing components, you could have some requests in your components to provide data filling, but that requests will be executed twice: during pre-rendering phase and after in rendering phase on server or client side depending on your render mode. Blazor.State can transfer your data received in pre-render phase and avoid requests execution during rendering, because data was already collected and stored.

### How is it working
Blazor.State gathers data collected from all properties marked by **ComponentStateAttribute**, builds a tree hierarchy of components, serializes it into JSONstring, encode that string with Base64 and stores it into HTML that will be sended to client.
